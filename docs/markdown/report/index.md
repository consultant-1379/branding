# Issues and New features

## Introduction

As this is a community based project it is dependent upon people in the community to report and possibly
solve the issues they find.
We also rely on community to suggest new ideas how to improve the UI SDK components and their
implementation.
We are open for feedback (both positive and negative).

It is very important to ask for new features and any improvements that may make life easier for other users
of the UI SDK.

New features can be discussed in the [New Features Discussion Forum](https://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/AL/New+Features+Discussion+Forum).

## Steps

1.  **Check the Forum**

    If you wish to report an issue, you should first check if it is a known issue on the [Asset Library Forum](https://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/AL/Forums).

2.  **Check the backlog**

    Check the backlog by checking all existing [UI SDK JIRA issues](http://jira-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1490)

    In the case you do not have JIRA available, you can contact [Tom Curran (PO)](mailto:tom.a.curran@ericsson.com).

3.  **Report the issue**

    Go to the
    [UI SDK JIRA](http://jira-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1490)
    page and create your issue.

    In the case of a bug, please describe the version of the library you are using, the expected
    result(s) and the actual result(s) you get.

    For every issue, make sure to write a clear description and to tag the relevant component:

    *   UI SDK
    *   Asset Library

    **Available tags:**
    Asset Library, Charting Library, Client Development Tools, Common UI Components, Common UI
    Services, HELP SDK, JavaScript Core Framework, REST SDK, UI Mapping, UI SDK, Widget Library.

4.  **Contact the Product Owner**

    Contact the product owner (
    [Tom Curran](mailto:tom.a.curran@ericsson.com))
    to see what are the plans with issue.

5.  **Contribute**

    If the issue is not being resolved and you wish to have a solution, you should consider becoming a
    contributor to the project and implement a solution yourself. See the
    [How to Contribute](../contribute/index.html)
    section for details on how to become a contributor and how to contribute an issue.
